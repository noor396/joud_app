# joud_app
An App that carries a humane cause and does charity work by distributing surplus food to people in need.


## 🚀 Motivation
An App with this idea hasn't been proposed before. There are lots of Apps that carry out similar missions, but 
they do not compare to Joud which gave its users a combination of social interaction along-side its main purpose.

## 🕹 Features
Joud supports the following features: Posting an announcement, private and public communication, and social media experience
for good cause.

## 🖥 Technologies used
<b>Built with</b>
- Flutter SDK
- Dart programming language
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
- [Material Design](https://material.io/)

## Developer Distribution Agreement
Due to Google Play policies, we were not able to publish Joud for public installations for the time it takes for
Google to approve the App.
